⚡ Fun fact: Therac-25 was a radiation therapy machine which was in use during the 1980s, it unfortunatly had a bug which caused it to deliver lethal doses of radiation to patients. The bug led to several deaths and serious injuries before the bug was fixed. Lesson of the story is bugs are the devil and computer science is secretly evil
